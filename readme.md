# Additive models
Collections of scripts that helps to find energies of electronic states using
additive model of computational chemistry.

The scripts were build to work with [CFOUR](https://cfour.uni-mainz.de/cfour/)
and rely heavily on the
[cfour_parser](https://github.com/the-pawel-wojcik/cfour_parser)
